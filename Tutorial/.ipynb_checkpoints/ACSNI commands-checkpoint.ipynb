    "# OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining context-specific circuit of biological pathways is a fundamental goal of molecular cell biology.\n",
    "ACSNI combines prior knowledge of biological processes (gene set) with a deep neural network to decompose gene \n",
    "expression profiles (GEP) into pathway activities and identify unknown pathway components, see Anene et al., 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Required inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gene expression matrix with genes in rows and samples in columns (format .csv).\n",
    "2. Gene set membership file representing prior knowledge of gene functions (format .csv)\n",
    "   For a single gene analysis, the second input is a gene name provided at run time.\n",
    "3. Optional- weight file (as integer values) for the genes in the second input. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# CASES\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the cases reported in the manuscript (Anene et al., 2021) (herein referred to as MTOR, ATF2 and HOTAIRM1 cases) to demonstrate how to set up, run ACSNI, interpret the results and navigate the extended database. "
